One of the challenges of working in a non-profit organization is managing limited resources, particularly when it comes to funding. Sometimes the reality often requires creative solutions when resources are scarce.

Recently, we faced the need to monitor all users in the organization using Office 365, especially to ensure that we weren’t over-allocating licenses. We have an A1 license, which doesn’t provide a comprehensive and convenient overview of user activity, requiring us to manually check user logs instead.

To address this challenge, I developed a PowerShell script with the following steps:

The script gathers all active users in the organization into a list.
Once a week, the script identifies users who logged into the system during the past week.
It updates the list by removing the mailboxes of users who logged in.
A new file is generated with the run results and date for issue tracking.

To ensure the script runs automatically and without issues, we scheduled it to run weekly on an organizational machine.

After several months of operation, we concluded that users who still appear on the list are likely inactive, and we identified around 600 unnecessary licenses that can be removed.

What did I learn from this process? Nothing is impossible. Despite budget constraints, with creative thinking and determination, you can find a solution to any challenge. Additionally, managing access to the organization is crucial – thanks to running this script, we were able to identify irrelevant users and significantly reduce our licensing costs.
